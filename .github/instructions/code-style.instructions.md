If asked to generate file content, always add a comment at the top of the file indicating that it was generated by Copilot. For example:
- for C++ files (*.cpp, *.h, *,hpp)
// Generated by copilot on behalf of Andrii

When generating code for method always add a description of what method takes as arguments and what it returns. For example:
```cpp
// Adds two integers and returns the result
// @param a First integer to add
// @param b Second integer to add
// @return The sum of a and b
int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
when looking for solutions for problems, consired the technology stack used in the project and prefer standard library functions and well-known libraries over custom implementations.
technology stack includes:

Backend:
- C++17
- PlatformIO
- Arduino framework
- ESPAsyncWebServer library for handling HTTP requests
- ArduinoJson library for JSON parsing and serialization
Frontend:
- html, css, javascript
Hardware:
- ESP32 microcontroller family
- Common sensors and actuators used with ESP32 and Arduino

Project structure:
- src/: source code files
- src/Api/: API related code
- src/Drivers/: Hardware drivers
- src/Utils/: Utility functions and helpers
- data/: Files to be uploaded to the device filesystem (SPIFFS/LittleFS)
- data/css/: CSS files for web interface
- data/js/: JavaScript files for web interface
- data/html/: HTML files for web interface
