If asked to generate file content, always add a comment at the top of the file indicating that it was generated by Copilot. For example:
- for C++ files (*.cpp, *.h, *,hpp)
// Generated by copilot on behalf of Andrii

When generating code for method always add a description of what method takes as arguments and what it returns. For example:
```cpp
// Adds two integers and returns the result
// @param a First integer to add
// @param b Second integer to add
// @return The sum of a and b
int Add(int a, int b) {
    return a + b;
}
```
when looking for solutions for problems, consired the technology stack used in the project and prefer standard library functions and well-known libraries over custom implementations.
technology stack includes:

Firmware:
- C++17
- PlatformIO
- Arduino framework

Hardware:
Project supports multiple hardware platforms, including:
- AtTinyX5 microcontroller family
- AtTiny 402 microcontroller family
- Common sensors and actuators used with Arduino

Project structure:
- src/: source code files

General guidelines:
- When generating code that relies on some custom #define values ensure that propper values are added to each platform, included to the project.
